Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of making your website better for search engines. The most used search engine in the world is Google Search. It's a fully-automated search engine that uses software known as web crawlers that explore the web. Google Search works in three stages: **Crawling**, **Indexing**, and **Serving search results**.

**Crawling** is about finding out what pages exist on the web. [Google Crawlers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers) is a program used to scan websites and Google's main crawler is called Googlebot. It's constantly looking for new and updated pages and adding them to a list of known pages.

**Indexing** is the process of understanding what the page is about by analyzing the HTML content of the web page like title element, metadata, alt attributes, images, videos, etc. For Google to index your website it has to be a [canonical page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls#what-is-a-canonical-url). A canonical is the page that may be shown in the search result.

**Serving search results** when a user searches on Google Search. A query is run in the search engine index for matching pages and returns the results believed to be the highest quality and most relevant to the user.

SEO is all about following best practices to hopefully make it easier for search engines to crawl, index, and understand your content. Often done by making small changes to your website. Lucky for us Google has a [Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide).

It goes over how to check if your website is indexed using the `site:` prefix, for example `site:wikipedia.org`.

Recommends creating a [sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) file for your website. Tell Google which pages are important to your site!

The starter guide is a great read! It goes over best practices and tools to help you be successful on Google Search! Once your content is in the search results. You can focus on controlling [how your results appear in Google Search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance).

I went through the starter guide and learned a lot! I created both a [sitemap.xml](https://www.jordanwu.xyz/sitemap.xml) and [robots.txt](https://www.jordanwu.xyz/robots.txt) file for my website. Learned how to use Google Search Console and URL Inspection Tool to get my pages indexed on Google. Started following best practices like [google images best practices](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images), [crawlable links](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/links-crawlable), [keep a simple url structure](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/url-structure), and more.
