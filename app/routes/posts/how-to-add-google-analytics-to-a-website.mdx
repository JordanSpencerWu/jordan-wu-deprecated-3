Google Analytics is [introducing the next generation of Analytics called Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681). GA4 is a new property designed to collect event-based data on your websites and applications. A [property](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9355666) is a term used to determine how data should be collected and analyzed together in Google Analytics reports.

There are two types of properties you can create. Google Analytics 4 property and Universal Analytics property. It's recommended to create a GA4 property. As the Universal Analytics property is going to be deprecated on **July 1, 2023**.

This is a free tool to help you better understand your customers and track meaningful events. [Setting up GA4](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/9303319) is easy! Depending on your use case there are guides to help you get started. For me I went through the [GA4 Set up Analytics for website and/or app guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153).

After going through the guide. I have a data stream ready to collect event data! To start collecting data. You would need to [add a Google tag directly to your website](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#add-tag&zippy=%2Cadd-the-google-tag-directly-to-your-web-pages). Or follow the steps to [add the tag to a website builder or CMS-hosted website](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#add-tag&zippy=%2Cadd-the-tag-to-a-website-builder-or-cms-hosted-website-eg-wordpress-shopify-etc).

Adding the Google tag is as easy as adding two script tags to your website! Be sure to replace `G_ID_GOES_HERE` with your own `G-ID`!

```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script
	async
	src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G_ID_GOES_HERE"
></script>
<script>
	window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
	function gtag() {
		dataLayer.push(arguments);
	}
	gtag("js", new Date());

	gtag("config", "G_ID_GOES_HERE");
</script>
```

Once you've add this, you should be collecting data. Please note that many of the Google Analytics reports take 24-48 hours to process data from your website.

GA4 is such a powerful tool and the best part is it's free to use! It allows you to collect data based on events. An [event](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9322688) allows you to measure a distinct user interaction on a website or app. It automatically collects basic events and recommends more events if you want to generate more useful reports. What makes G4A powerful is that ability to create your own custom events! This helps you measure additional information that is important to your website!

Now that you have a collection of event data. It's time to make sense of it! Data analytics is all about making sense of your data using data visualizations. This is where G4A reporting comes in. Inside your [Google Analytics dashboard](analytics.google.com) you will see reporting of the data you are collecting. There a real-time dashboard, if you want to see what events are happening in real-time. If you want to learn more about reporting check out [GA4 Understanding Google Analytics Reports](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9212670).

I recommend adding Google Analytics to your website and/or applications! This is a powerful tool to help you understand your customers and to track meaningful events. It's free to use and is easy to add. Hope this is useful and happy coding!
