[Beatport](https://www.beatport.com) is an online music store. Where you can find the latest electronic dance music and house tracks. The website helps you keep up to date with new releases and shows the top 10 tracks on Beatport. Many DJs use it to buy their favorite tracks and to build their music collection.

An important aspect of being a DJ is sharing music! That's why I want to be a DJ. Music is what makes me feel happy and I want to share that feeling with everyone! To start we need to build our own music collection.

There are many ways to buy a track. You can buy it offline in a store or buy it online on a website. Then there are different formats of the track you can buy, like a CD, a vinyl record, an audio file, etc. The audio file being the most popular. On Beatport you have the options to buy a track in the following audio file formats: MP3, AIFF, and WAV.

The difference between MP3 and WAV/AIFF is a matter of "compressed" or "lossless" format. MP3 is a compressed version of a WAV/AIFF lossless track. Compression reduces the file size of the track and the major drawback is lossy, which means portions of the audio information are intentionally discarded in order to reduce the size of the file. What is important is to use WAV/AIFF for editing and use MP3 for distribution.

As a DJ you might want to buy the lossless format of the track. This allows you to edit the track in your favorite digital audio workstation (DAW) with a more precise representation of the audio waveform. And you can always convert the lossless format to the MP3 format. By paying a little more for the lossless format you have more flexibility.

For me Beatport has been the best website for me to build my music collection. I tried other websites that are subscription based and did not get the results that I wanted. What makes Beatport stand out from others is that they have the biggest collection of EDM tracks, offer the lossless audio file format, and display useful DJ information of the track like key, scale, and BPM.

You have to check out Beatport if you haven't already! You can find many great tracks to add to your music collection. As you are building your collection. You will start to define your own taste in music! Lastly Beatport is a great tool to manage your music collection as it stores your purchased tracks.
