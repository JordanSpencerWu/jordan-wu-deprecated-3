[1001 Tracklists](https://www.1001tracklists.com) is a great website for anyone who wants to listen to DJ sets! This site is amazing! Not only does it help you keep up to date with DJ sets around the world, but you can see the track list used in the set. You no longer have to wonder what's the name of the song that was played at your favorite DJ's set! You can find all the information here!

This is such a helpful resource for music lovers to discover new songs. There's a stories section for you to learn more about your favorite artists or new artists you have yet to discover. A section for the hottest DJ sets and top songs this week. And don't forget how easy it is to add new music to your Spotify account with a click of a button!

The website is well designed and I like how it focuses on displaying what is important to the users. Like on the home page, the user can see all the latest DJ sets as the default order. But can change the order by to the most liked or viewed. The infinite scrolling of the DJ sets is very slick and it supports dark mode.

I have been using this website each day to listen to DJ sets. My focus is to find all the tracks used in my favorite DJ sets and seeing how the tracks are mixed together. This is a good way to learn more about DJing by studying your favorite DJ sets. Still wondering why some tracks resonate more than others and finding which genre I like the most.

Overall I recommend this website for anyone who loves music! You will find many gems here and be up to date with the hottest club tracks. This is the website I wished I had when I was younger and we are lucky that it exists! Huge shout out to the developers, maintainers, and DJs!
