Having your own website is a great way to market your brand! A way to sell yourself to the world. Stand out from the crowd. A platform for you to learn and grow. Be who you are. Talk about what you love. Share your knowledge. It's limitless. What are you waiting for create your own website and own a piece of estate on the web.

I created my own website using a web framework called [Remix](https://remix.run). I started learning Remix after reading their [blog](https://remix.run/blog/remix-vs-next) where they compared it to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It's built on a popular component library called [React](https://reactjs.org). A user interface library that allows developers to create reusable components that are declarative and self-contained.

The best way to learn Remix is by reading their [docs](https://remix.run/docs) and doing their [tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes). As mentioned on their website, it's a full stack web framework that can serve your full stack application needs and fit perfectly into the "Backend for your Frontend" architecture known as BFF strategy. What I like about Remix is it's server-side rendering "SSR'' and MDX support, both are great for a blog website.

In the docs there's a section for styling Remix. I recommend going with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and going through their [setup steps](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/remix). Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to style your website using utility classes. It's optimized for production and only generates the utility classes you are actually using in your project. It works well with mobile-first responsive design, supports dark mode, and is very customizable through it's configurations.

As mentioned before Remix has [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) support. MDX allows you to use JSX in your [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) content. This gives you flexibility. You can add anything in your blog that is not markdown. There's a Tailwind plugin to style your MDX called [typography-plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin). For syntax highlighting you can use [rehype-highlight](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight), the setup steps are [here](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/mdx#advanced-configuration).

For storing your blog post images you can use an image hosting service. I used [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The free tier gives you 5GB of storage and allows you to scale as your website grows. Its pay-as-you-go approach for pricing is great for paying what you are using and lets you rent more resources during peak hours. Remember to compress your image before storing them in S3. That way the download size is reduced, I used [tinypng](https://tinypng.com).

Once you're done creating your website, it's time to buy a domain name. A domain name is a unique identifier that all browsers use to find the right Internet Protocol "IP" address that stores all your web resources. You can buy a domain at any publicly traded Internet domain registrar. I used [Google Domains](https://domains.google) and bought a domain with a top-level domain of "xyz", commonly used in the Web3 space.

Now for the deployment. When you create your Remix project you can pick a deployment target. You can use any web hosting service that can deploy a NodeJS application. I went with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) a cloud platform that enables developers to host websites and web services. It has many integrations include one for [GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-github) and docs on [how to setup your custom domain](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains). Going through these steps will allow you to store your Remix project on GitHub and Vercel will deploy your web application every time you commit to your main branch.

That's it! That's the whole process of how I created my website using Remix. It was a fun process and I enjoyed the whole journey from planning to implementing. Hope you learn something and happy coding!
