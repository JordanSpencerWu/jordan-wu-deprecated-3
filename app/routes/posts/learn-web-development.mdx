Web development is about creating an application that runs in a browser. All devices these days have a browser pre-installed on it. Everyone knows how to use it from searching on Google to watching YouTube videos. For this reason many companies are hiring software engineers to build web applications. There's money to be made on this platform and many users are using it everyday. This is why you should learn web development!

A **client** is a term used to define a user facing application. It's a fancy way of saying an application that the user interacts with. There are many clients that users can use to interact with an application. Spotify users for example can access the application on the browser, desktop, and mobile phones. The main difference between the clients is that both desktop and mobile applications have to be installed by the user beforehand. The web client on the other hand is more flexible and allows users access to any web client. This means you can be listening to music on Spotify while shopping on Amazon on the same browser, at the same time!

A website is made up of three main components: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. There are many ways to learn them for example videos, blogs, tutorials, books, courses, docs, etc. Whatever works for you. This is great for when you are getting started and are learning the basics. The most helpful resource I use is [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). It's what I have open when working on a web application.

## HTML

[HTML: HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is the building block of a website. It defines the structure and layout of the content. As you read the guides you will learn what are HTML elements and their attributes. How to display images, forms, videos, etc. A good reference when working with HTML elements!

## CSS

[CSS: Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is a language used to style HTML elements. It describes how the elements should be rendered on screen. As you read the guides you will learn how to add css stylesheets to a website, how to define css rules and how it works, the box model, css selectors, styling elements, etc. A good reference when styling elements on your webpage!

## JavaScript

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a programming language that is used to make the website more interactive. Without JavaScript all websites will be static and can only display information. Lucky for us all browsers can run JavaScript! As you read the guide you will learn how to use the programming language. A good reference when coding in JavaScript! Another good resource is called [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/).

## Conclusion

There's more to learn about web development like the [DOM (Document Object Model)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) that is part of the [Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) and [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP). All web applications run in a browser and have access to the Web API. This allows developers to make changes to a webpage.

When learning something new it's important to find good resources! The MDN web page is a good one for web development. This is my go to reference when working on a web client. I never memorize and always use references. If I had to learn web development today. I would use [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and watch their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp). They provide quality learning materials for everyone at all levels. Hope this blog was useful and happy learning!
