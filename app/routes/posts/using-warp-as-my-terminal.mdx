[Warp](https://www.warp.dev) is a modern day terminal that is fast and developer friendly! I decided to switch from [ITerm2](https://iterm2.com) to Warp after hearing about it. ITerm2 is great and gets the job done. But it lacks the look and feel of a modern application. Lucky for us. The team at Warp saw a need for innovation and started working on Warp, a terminal for the 21st century.

Speed was the most important priority for Warp to stand out. Many of its user experience enhancements were adding a layer of user interface UI on top of the terminal. That means a lot of rendering of pixels onto the screen. Picking the right tools built for speed is critical for Warp to be a de facto terminal in the future.

The team decided to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), a fast language similar to C++ and C in terms of speed and performance. The rendering will be on the GPU and not the CPU. GPU-accelerated rendering for terminals is common these days. It allows the rendering of high resolution text on a 4K display and at a very high FPS possible.

Here's a [list of features](https://docs.warp.dev/features/ai-command-search) for you to try! I have been using this terminal for a month and I don't plan on going back to ITerm2! Warp has made my life easier as a developer and I feel more productive using it. If you haven't already you should check out Warp!
