[Rekordbox](https://rekordbox.com/) is a cloud management software designed for all DJs. You can manage all your music collections from different platforms all in one place and are used with [Pioneer DJ](https://www.pioneerdj.com/) equipments. Pioneer DJ equipment is the industry standard for all major nightclubs, entertainment venues, and festivals. They have been battle tested for many years as the most reliable DJ equipment out there.

The first step is to [download the desktop client](https://rekordbox.com/en/download/). Once you have it installed, you can start adding tracks and each track will be analyzed and formatted with meta information like the Track Title, Artwork, Artist, Genre, BPM, etc. All your tracks will be in the **Collection** section and you can start creating your playlist in the **Playlists** section.

There are two available modes. The **Export mode** is used to transfer tracks to USB drives and play them on Pioneer DJ equipment. While the **Performance mode** is playing tracks on your computer. It's important to export your **Collection** and **Playlists** in **Export mode** before playing on any Pioneer DJ equipment. It allows the equipment to display the track's information correctly for example the track's waveform and includes all your cue points.

My current workflow is [Mixed In Key with Rekordbox](https://mixedinkey.com/harmonic-mixing-guide/pioneer-dj-rekordbox-key-detection/). Having Mixed In Key analyze the key of the track, add the cue points, and add metadata has saved me a lot of time! It does a great job at adding the cue points at the breakdown and drop. Along with using [Platinum Notes](https://www.platinumnotes.com/) to optimize all the tracks to get the best possible sound quality. You can check out the [Pioneer Rekordbox Integration](https://mixedinkey.com/integration/rekordbox-integration/) to see the workflow.

For more information on how to use Rekordbox. I recommend checking out the "Instruction Manual" in the [manual page](https://rekordbox.com/en/download/#manual).
