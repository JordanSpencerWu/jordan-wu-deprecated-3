The kick sound is the backbone of all EDM tracks. It's the sound that everyone dances to. The sound for beatmatching. The sound that will make or break your track. The sound that makes a dance track.

Finding a good kick is hard! You can download free kick samples or buy them. But from my experience many samples aren't good enough and have tiny artifacts that make them imperfect. This is where kick drum synthesis comes in. It might be better to sound design your own kick instead of trying to find the perfect kick to your track. This will allow you to sculpt your kicks for your tracks!

[Sonic Academy Kick 2](https://www.sonicacademy.com/products/kick-2) is a VST plugin for creating kick sounds. It has everything you need to sculpt the right kick. It's a powerful tool that gives you full control of sculpting every aspect of the kick sound.

The kick can be categorized into three parts. The **transient**, **body**, and **tail**. The **transient** defines the mid-high to high frequencies content of your kick. This can be a click, snare, or clap sound. The **body** define the low frequencies content and usually consists of a sine wave that acts like a sub oscillator. This is where you can pitch the sine wave to the key of your track. Lastly, the **tail** is part of the body and determines how much space the kick takes.

The Kick 2 VST plugin provides you all the tools you need to control the transient, body, and tail of the kick! It comes with default presets and you can purchase [more presets](https://www.sonicacademy.com/products/all?feat=false&item_format=Kick+2+Presets) on their website. It's easy to learn and use! Here is the [manual](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jordanwu.xyz.images/kick-drum-synthesis-with-sonic-academy-kick-2/kick-2-manual.pdf.pdf) and a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gJ7x9wiCrc&ab_channel=SonicAcademy) for you to learn.

For me I decided to learn this VST plugin so that I don't have to rely on finding sampled kicks. It's going to take time to learn this tool, but in my opinion will save me a lot of time in the future. What I like about this plugin is it allows you to sculpt the kick with your track. What I mean by that is you can make tiny adjustments to your kick while the track is playing. It allows you to create a kick that works with the track you're creating at the moment.
