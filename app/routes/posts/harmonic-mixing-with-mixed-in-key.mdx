Harmonic Mixing is a technique used by DJs when mixing between tracks. Each track is created in a key and scale. We can use this information along with our circle of fifth knowledge from music theory to know which tracks are compatible. The circle of fifths is based on the root key and it's perfect fifth. I'll explain this using the **Amin** chord.

![A Minor Chord](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jordanwu.xyz.images/harmonic-mixing-with-mixed-in-key-1.png "A Minor Chord")

The **Amaj** chord is made up of three keys, **A**, **C**, and **E**. The fundamental frequency of that chord is the lowest frequency which is **A** also known as the **root** key. If you look at a [frequencies chart](https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html) for piano keys you can see all the frequencies for each key. Let's use the **A** above middle **C** key because it has an easy to remember frequency of 440 Hz.

There's something in music theory called perfect intervals, these intervals are fourths, fifths, and octaves. It is based on their frequency's ratio compared to the fundamental frequency. For example, a perfect octave has a ratio of 2:1, a perfect octave for our fundamental frequency 400 Hz is 880 Hz. That's the next **A** key on the piano keyboard! The perfect fourth has a ratio of 4:3 and a perfect fifth has a ratio of 3:2.

If you look at the **Amaj** chord or **Amin** chord you will notice that the perfect fifth is **E** while our root is **A**. Based on the frequency ratio we know when we play **A** and **E** together it sounds good because the frequency is very similar! What about the key between them? The third interval determines if the chord is major or minor.

Now that we know about perfect intervals. Let's quickly talk about the scale of a track. We know that a minor scale creates mellow melodies and a major scale creates happy melodies, this is a very generalized way to describe minor and major scales. The most important takeaway is that a scale determines the notes played in a track.

Now harmonic mixing is based off of the perfect interval, but focuses on the perfect fifth! What do you mean it's based on the perfect fifth? Let's take a look at how to use the Camelot Wheel.

![Camelot Wheel](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jordanwu.xyz.images/harmonic-mixing-with-mixed-in-key-2.png "Camelot Wheel")

A track is represented by a **number** and a **letter**. The number represents all possible key on a piano and the letter represents the scales minor or major. We know there are 12 possible piano keys before we start repeating the same keys.

Looking at the Camelot Wheel, let's imagine we are playing a track that has a key of **A** and is in the **minor** scale as known as **Amin**. We know that every minor scale has a relative major scale and vice versa. In our case, **Amin** has a relative major scale **Cmaj**. We can mix it with another track that is in **Emin** (clockwise), **Dmin** (counter clockwise), **Amin** (same), or **Cmaj** (relative key) shown below.

Let's understand the term up a fifth means on the Camelot Wheel. It says we can go from **Amin** to **Emin**. Let's use the piano keyboard to visualize this.

![A root key perfect fifth](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jordanwu.xyz.images/harmonic-mixing-with-mixed-in-key-4.png "A root key perfect fifth")

We learned earlier that **E** was the perfect fifth of **A**! We know that the frequency ratio is 3:2 and the frequencies are very similar. That means if we mix a track from **Amin** to **Emin** it will sound like they belong together because the frequencies are similar.

What's the biggest takeaway from this? As we move clockwise on the wheel, we are going up a perfect fifth from the root. And we know that the perfect fifth for both minor and major scales is 7 half-steps or semitones up from the root key.

Let's test this theory out using **C** as our root and the scale does not matter!

![C root key perfect fifth](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jordanwu.xyz.images/harmonic-mixing-with-mixed-in-key-5.png "C root key perfect fifth")

Remember, we are going up, but what does that mean? Going up means we are counting the keys above our root, these keys have higher frequencies and a higher pitch. Now let's start counting to 7 starting with the key next to **C** which is the black key called **C#**. Counting all the half-steps until we hit 7, will be our perfect fifth! The perfect fifth for **C** is **G** and it matches with the Camelot Wheel. Going clockwise we can see **Cmin** -> **Gmin** and **Cmaj** -> **Gmaj**.

Now we know what up a fifth means. Let's focus on what down a fifth means. But let's take some time to think about this. Going down a fifth is like the opposite of going up a fifth. In other words, using the keyboard above. Down a fifth for **G** which was previous known as our perfect fifth but we are naming it our root will be **C**. This matches what the Camelot Wheel, going counter clockwise **Gmin** -> **Cmin** and **Gmaj** -> **Cmaj**.

Wait there's a pattern here! Going up a fifth means going up 7 half-steps and going down a fifth means going down 7 half-steps. Are you telling me if I know how to count to 7 then I will know how to mix my tracks? Yes! Having these labels makes it easy for DJs to mix a track without looking at the Camelot Wheel or counting to 7!

Now that we know about harmonic mixing let's talk about [Mixed In Key](https://mixedinkey.com). Mixed In Key is a powerful software used by DJs all around the world. You can use this software to find the key and scale, BPM, energy level, and cue points of any track. It can be used along with [Platinum Notes](https://www.platinumnotes.com), a software that improves the quality of your tracks. And it integrates with many mainstream DJ software like [Serato](https://serato.com/dj), [Traktor](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/catalog/traktor/dj-software), and [Rekordbox](https://rekordbox.com).
