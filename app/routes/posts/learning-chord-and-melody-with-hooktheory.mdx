[Hooktheory](https://www.hooktheory.com) helps musicians create amazing music! To create amazing music you first need to have a deep understanding and intuition for how music works. The website provides many interactive learning materials to help you understand music theory.

To learn music theory. You can read their [Hooktheory book series](https://www.hooktheory.com/books) containing Hooktheory I and Hooktheory II. After reading them you will have a solid understanding of music theory and know how to analyze your favorite songs. In my opinion, it is worth buying.

The series goes over musical scales. Each scale consists of seven notes and is the building blocks of a song. The note itself is not that important. What is important is the note's position in a scale. Relative notation is used to determine the note's position in the scale called scale degrees and this is how you can compare chords and melodies in different scales.

There are seven notes in a scale, there end up being only seven basic chords. It goes over the function of all the chords and a scale consisting of three major chords, three minor chords, and one diminished chord. The function of the I chord is called home base while the function of IV chord and V chord serves as a transition back to I chord called cadence chords. Learn about sequences of chords called chord progressions. And the lowest note or bass note in a chord is the most important note.

A measure contains beats and on a four-beat measure. Beat 1 and 3 are strong, while beats 2 and 4 are weak. Notes in the melody that are played on strong beats are more important than notes played on weak beats.

The relationship between the chords and melody is based on stable and unstable scale degrees. When a melody contains a note that is also part of the chord being played is called stable scale degrees. Unstable scale degrees refer to the scale degrees that are not contained in the underlying chords. To create tension you can use both stable and unstable scale degrees and the note's position in the measure affects how much importance it has. For example a unstable note used on a weak beat to link two stable scale degrees together is called a passing note.

What is great about the books is after each chapter there is a summary chapter with quizzes to test your understanding. The interactive materials are all color coded for both the melody and chords. This makes analyzing them easier. You can play the interactive material to hear and see the chords and melody being played.

The website provides many good learning resources! My favorite one is the [TheoryTab Database](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab). A database full of chords and melodies of popular songs. You can use it to analyze your favorite songs! Hooktheory provides many great resources for you to create amazing music!
